# emc-human-movement
A topological data analysis of human movement, part of our EMC

Logs data from a leap motion sensor using python 2.7, which is then stored in a csv for analysis. Using MATLAB and the Javaplex library, this is then topologically analysed for persistant homology and other patterns.
